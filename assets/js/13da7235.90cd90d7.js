It uses ontology-aware natural language processing (NLP) models to map variable names to standardized biomedical terms. This facilitates cross-study data integration, meta-analysis, and downstream harmonization workflows.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"API/match":{"id":"API/match","title":"match Endpoint","description":"The /match endpoint performs intelligent semantic matching between raw variable names (e.g., from a dataset or data dictionary) and standardized biomedical ontology terms. This endpoint is especially useful for curating or harmonizing variables before full dataset processing.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"API/overview":{"id":"API/overview","title":"API Overview","description":"The OMSIM API enables seamless semantic harmonization of data dictionaries and clinical datasets by leveraging natural language processing, ontology integration, and intelligent variable matching. It is designed to help researchers and data managers align diverse datasets to standard biomedical ontologies with minimal manual effort.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"API/validate":{"id":"API/validate","title":"validate Endpoint","description":"The /validate endpoint allows you to check if a data dictionary or dataset meets the structural, syntactic, and metadata requirements before proceeding to harmonization. This step is crucial for ensuring that the uploaded file has all required fields, uses the correct formats, and follows OMSIM standards.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture":{"id":"architecture","title":"System Architecture","description":"This section provides an overview of the system architecture behind OMSIM \u2014 the Ontology-Mediated Semantic Integration and Matching platform. The architecture is designed to ensure scalability, modularity, and efficiency for variable harmonization across heterogeneous biomedical datasets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"authentication":{"id":"authentication","title":"Authentication","description":"To ensure secure access, all OMSIM API endpoints require authentication via a Bearer token system. This allows us to track, authorize, and manage access for users, systems, and third-party services interacting with OMSIM.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"errors":{"id":"errors","title":"Error Handling","description":"The OMSIM API follows standard HTTP status code conventions and provides clear error messages for troubleshooting. This guide outlines common error types, their meanings, and how to resolve them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"examples":{"id":"examples","title":"Example Workflows","description":"This page demonstrates real-world use cases for the OMSIM API. These examples show how to interact with the /match, /harmonize, and /validate endpoints using sample datasets or data dictionaries.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction to OMSIM","description":"Welcome to the official documentation for OMSIM - the Ontology-Mediated Semantic Integration and Matching engine. This platform is designed to assist researchers, developers, and data stewards in the automated harmonization and alignment of variable names across heterogeneous datasets using semantic and ontological principles.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"support":{"id":"support","title":"Support","description":"If you encounter issues, have questions, or need assistance while using OMSIM, this page provides the channels and guidelines for getting help, reporting bugs, and contributing to the project.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"versioning":{"id":"versioning","title":"API Versioning","description":"Versioning is essential for maintaining backward compatibility and enabling the safe evolution of the OMSIM API over time. This document explains how versioning is implemented and how you can specify which version to use when making requests.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
